README for Avo Sarkissian's Assignment 5
This Python project demonstrates basic mathematical operations through a command-line interface. It includes operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, calculating the square and factorial of numbers, counting from start to end, calculating the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle, calculating the area of a rectangle, and determining the power of a number.

Add Numbers: Adds two numbers provided by the user.
Perform Operation: Performs a basic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers.
Square Number: Returns the square of a number.
Factorial: Computes the factorial of a number.
Counting: Displays counting from a start number to an end number.
Compute Hypotenuse: Computes the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle given the base and perpendicular.
Area of Rectangle: Calculates the area of a rectangle given its width and height.
Power of Number: Computes the power of a number given a base and an exponent.
Type of Argument: Returns the type of the provided argument.
